## Getting Started

1- We shared our point of views about the lab insterctions.

2- Leen created a repo, and we clone it in our machines. 

3- We copied the starter-code from the main repo.

4- We followed the trello cards and the To-Do lists in the VS code.

5- We split the tasks between us, using two branches each time one of us was the driver and the second was the navigator.
